# Attack Graph
All attack paths for exploiting vulnerabilities in SCASS have already been compiled and are available in the ag-pdf directory. However, if you are interested in recompiling the attack paths, you can utilize the Makefile utility by executing the following commands:

    ```bash
    make all
    ```

    ```bash
   make scenario1
   ```

    ```bash
   make scenario2
   ```

Notably, this utility requires Docker to work.
